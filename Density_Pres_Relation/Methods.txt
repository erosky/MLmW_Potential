Measure the pres v density relation in a range of temperatures that are used in our simulations.
temperature range is 205 to 230

every 5 Kelvin would be 205, 210, 215, 220, 225, 230

Pressures would range from 500 atm to -1000 atm in intervals of 50 atm for a total of 30 pressures

To run, write a script that iterates through the temperature directories 

Aug 23 night - run press v density on laptop

Aug 24 portland - run between plates freezing runs... like 5 of them in the -500 and 1 atm temperature range, on supercomputer? or on research machine.

4 ns simulations

workflow:
- create template input file
- make script to set up each case using template
- test some cases
- start running sims.


Setup scripts:
create_runs.sh temperature pressure
- cd into temperature folder
- make folder for pressure and put input file and potential file into the folder

setup_runs.sh 
for each temperature
- create temperature directory
- run create_runs for each pressure

execute_runs.sh
for each temperature
- cd into the folder
for each pressure
- cd into folder and run script



Analysis:
want a data file for each temperature giving 2 rows - pressure, density
Plot each dataset together on one plot

Test out one temperature first before running all
