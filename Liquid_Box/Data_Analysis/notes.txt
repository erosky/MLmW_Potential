Use "extract_from_log.sh LOG_FILE OUTPUT_DAT_FILE" to take just the lines from the simulation log file with data in them. You must edit the script to take the correct start and end lines from the log file. This will output the data to OUTPUT_DAT_FILE.

Make sure the input data column labels in "compute_properties.py" match the columns of the input data.

Use "compute_properties.py" by inputing the data file (from "extract_from_log.sh")

So far it looks like compute_properties.py is just a fancy version of validate_water.py
May be able to just delete validate_water.py soon.

Also the output file option in these two files doesn't actually do anything.
