Flat Interface - use a slab

https://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/compute_stress_atom.html

output of compute: xx, yy, zz, xy, xz, yz

Surface tension computed should not change if slab thickness changes I think.
Try two different thicknesses and see.

Pn(z) = Pzz(z) = sum off Pzz of all atoms in slice V(z) divided by V(z)

Pt(z) = 1/2[Pxx(z) + Pyy(z)]

In the supplementary material of Tianshu Lu Nat Comm,
the pressure tensor compunents are a volume average of the per atom component in the slice volume.


create data file that is z, Pxx(z), Pyy(z), Pzz(z), Pn(z), Pt(z)

then use that as input file for integrating

Instructions
------------------

compute_components.sh invokes the compute_components.awk script
and creates components.dat

components.dat is input to integral.sh
