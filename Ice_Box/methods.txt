Need to make sure we get the ice density close to that on ML-mW
The density of ice in ML-mW is much lower than for the mW model.

so we need to determine the correct lattice constant L
There are 8 atoms in the diamond lattice cell, with endge length L

8/L^3 = Number density

NumDens = 0.0310473103 N/A^3

L = 6.36339
